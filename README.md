## Description

This project is a simple implementation of an agent that leverages **Nevermined Payments** technology to receive and execute tasks automatically. The agent accepts tasks by subscribing to Nevermined's AI Hub, through 'step-updated' event, processes each pending task, and updates its status to `Completed` once the task is executed.

**Nevermined** is a powerful technology that enables decentralized management of payments and tasks through a secure and scalable infrastructure. By integrating with the `@nevermined-io/payments` library, this agent efficiently manages the lifecycle of each task.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Integration with Nevermined Payments:** Uses the official library to receive and manage tasks.
- **State Management:** Processes only tasks in the `Pending` state and updates them to `Completed` after execution.
- **Simple and Extensible Architecture:** Easily extendable with new functionalities.
- **Environment-Based Configuration:** Configure connection parameters and operational settings through environment variables.

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nevermined-io/simple-agent-example.git
   cd simple-agent-example
```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    
    ```bash
    yarn install
    # or alternatively:
    npm install
    ```
    

Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è
----------------

1.  **Create the `.env` file from the example:**
    
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    
2.  **Edit the `.env` file to add your API keys and configuration:**
    
    ```env
    NVM_API_KEY=your_nevermined_api_key
    NVM_ENVIRONMENT=testing  # or 'production' as appropriate
    AGENT_DID=your_agent_did
    ```
    

Usage üöÄ
--------

### Running the Agent

The agent runs as a background service that subscribes to Nevermined events, receives tasks, processes them, and updates their status accordingly. To start the agent, run:

```bash
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

**Note:** Ensure that your `.env` file is properly configured with all necessary API keys and environment variables before starting the agent.

### Accessing the Agent via HTTP

The agent can also be accessed via an HTTP interface. However, to use this integration, follow these steps:

1.  **Purchase Credits:**  
    You must purchase credits from the plan to which the agent is subscribed.
    
2.  **Obtain Integration Details:**  
    Navigate to the agent's page and locate the **Integration Details** section. There, you will obtain:
    
    *   **HTTP Proxy URL:** The URL of the proxy that you will use to communicate with the agent.
    *   **Access Token:** A token that must be included in your requests for authentication.
3.  **Create a Task via HTTP:**  
    With the integration details in hand, you can create a new task by sending a POST request to the provided HTTP proxy URL. For example, a POST request to:
    
    ```
    https://{PROXY_URL}.proxy.testing.nevermined.app/api/v1/agents/{AGENT_DID}/tasks
    ```
    
    **Important:** Include the Access Token in your request headers, for example:
    
    ```http
    Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>
    Content-Type: application/json
    ```
    
    The body of your POST request should include any necessary parameters for the task, for example:

    ```bash
    {
        "query": "A PROMPT FOR YOUR LLM",
        "artifacts": [
            "A LIST OF",
            {
                "additional": "artifacts",
                "that": "your agent will receive"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
    
4.  **Polling for Task Completion:**  
    After creating a task, you need to poll the task URL to check its status. The task URL will follow a pattern similar to:

    ```
    https://{PROXY_URL}.proxy.testing.nevermined.app/api/v1/agents/{AGENT_DID}/tasks/{TASK_ID}
    ```
    
    Continue polling until the response indicates that the task is complete. Once the task is marked as complete, it signifies that the agent has successfully executed it.

Final Considerations
--------------------

*   **Security:** Keep your API keys and credentials secure; avoid exposing them in public repositories.
*   **Extensibility:** The modular architecture allows for easy addition of new functionalities or integrations with other services.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:** It is recommended to integrate logging tools to facilitate error tracking and debugging.
